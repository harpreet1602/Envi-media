# Envi-media
Our idea is to create an environment based social media platform. 
By creating such a web application, we aim to solve the global challenges of afforestation, waste management and animal care. 
This is going to be the next ground-breaking idea, which will bring the NGO's, environmentalists and nature lovers to work together, and know each other. 
Based on the work done by the users, there will be a score-based reward system. The app, like any other social media platform, will have shareable app profiles for users to share and encourage others around them. 
The organizations which host events like cleaning drives, mass tree planting, etc can share it in the app and the users can show their interests in participating. 
The app will have challenges like "30 days of nature", in which the users will be given a task to perform daily.
The web app will also show a detailed pollution report of the user's city. 
Lastly, the tech stack we plan to use is ReactJS for frontend, API with ExpressJS, NodeJS as backend, firebase and MongoDB as the database.
